Design an AI Agent Flexible Memory System inspired by the hippocampal theory of memory. The system should integrate with a large language model (LLM) and operate at the embedding level. The memory system must meet the following requirements:

Core Features:
Memory Accumulation:

Continuously ingest and store data provided to the system in a structured memory database.
Support multi-level memory storage:
Team Memory (local interactions).
Organizational Memory (inter-departmental knowledge).
Enterprise Memory (global organizational context).
Dynamic Memory Recall:

Generate and retrieve relevant past memories based on current input data.
Prioritize highly relevant memories for immediate recall while archiving less relevant data for long-term storage.
Data Comparison and Analysis:

Compare past data with current input data to identify:
Similarities and patterns.
Anomalies or changes.
Insights and recommendations based on historical trends.
Embedding-Level Operation:

Represent all data (past and current) as embeddings to ensure efficient similarity comparison.
Leverage vector similarity search to retrieve contextually relevant information.
Functional Requirements:
Implement temporal reasoning to align past events with the timeline of the current data.
Allow memory contextualization based on:
Agent roles (e.g., task-specific memory).
Domain knowledge (e.g., engineering, marketing).
Provide real-time memory updates without disrupting system performance.
Output Generation:
The AI Agent should output recommendations, summaries, or insights by combining:
Current input data.
Relevant past memories.
Comparative analysis results.
Technical Considerations:
Embedding Database:

Utilize a scalable vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Milvus, or FAISS) to store and manage memory embeddings.
Memory Structuring:

Store data hierarchically (Team, Organization, Enterprise) with metadata tags to ensure precise recall.
Adaptability:

Design the system to adapt to evolving input data and refine memory relevance criteria over time using reinforcement learning techniques.
Use Cases:
Project management with team-level memory recall for ongoing tasks.
Organizational decision-making by accessing historical performance data.
Enterprise-wide knowledge sharing and collaboration.
Deliverables:
The system should produce:

Contextually relevant outputs based on a blend of past and current data.
Clear explanations of how past memories influenced the generated output.
Scalable integration options to extend memory to new teams, departments, or enterprises.
End Goal:
Create an intelligent, flexible, and adaptive memory system that mimics human memory dynamics, enhances decision-making, and optimizes performance at all organizational levels.
